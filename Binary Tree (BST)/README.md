# About Binary Tree

Binary search tree, as shown in its name, is an ordered tree data structure. Every parent nodes has at most two children, every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent and every node to the right of the parent node is always greater than the parent.

if value is less than than the root then should be left subtree.

If value is bigger than the root then should be right subtree.
